# Introduction
> Q1:<br>A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some task T and some performance measure P if its performance on T, as measured by P, improves with experience E. Suppose we feed a learning algorithm a lot of historical weather data, and have it learn to predict weather. What would be a reasonable choice for P?

P is The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.

T is The weather prediction task.

E is The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.

The weather prediction task.
The probability of it correctly predicting a future date's weather.
The process of the algorithm examining a large amount of historical weather data.
None of these.

>Q2:<br>
Suppose you are working on weather prediction, and you would
like to predict whether or not it will be raining at 5pm
tomorrow. You want to use a learning algorithm for this.
Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?

- Classification

>Q3:<br>
Suppose you are working on stock market prediction, and you
would like to predict the price of a particular stock tomorrow
(measured in dollars). You want to use a learning algorithm for this.
Would you treat this as a classification or a regression problem?

- Classification

>Q4:<br>
Some of the problems below are best addressed using a supervised learning algorithm, and the others with an unsupervised learning algorithm. Which of the following would you apply supervised learning to? (Select all that apply.) In each case, assume some appropriate dataset is available for your algorithm to learn from.

- [x] Given 50 articles written by male authors, and 50 articles written by female authors, learn to predict the gender of a new manuscript's author (when the identity of this author is unknown).
- [] Examine a large collection of emails that are known to be spam email, to discover if there are sub-types of spam mail.
- [] Given data on how 1000 medical patients respond to an experimental drug (such as effectiveness of the treatment, side effects, etc.), discover whether there are different categories or "types" of patients in terms of how they respond to the drug, and if so what these categories are.
- [x] Examine the statistics of two football teams, and predicting which team will win tomorrow's match (given historical data of teams' wins/losses to learn from).

>Q5:<br>
Which of these is a reasonable definition of machine learning?

- [x] Machine learning is the field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed.
- [ ] Machine learning is the science of programming computers.
- [ ] Machine learning means from labeled data.
- [ ] Machine learning is the field of allowing robots to act intelligently.
